At night enthusiastic (and at times eccentric) people fill the streets in the Pike/Pine corridor (about a half mile away) enjoying the diverse entertainment and the culture of openness and acceptance. Spontaneous street parties have been known to break out with music playing and people dancing in the streets like on Election Day 2008 and the freak snow storm in December 2008 (snow is very unusual in Seattle and can stifle transit). In these instances, police officers observe but will usually let the revelling continue.

We first stayed at an Airbnb location in Sydney, Australia, while honeymooning in January 2012, and were so impressed with our experience that we are now hooked! Not only are the Airbnb properties a good value, but more importantly, we have had amazing interactions with each of the hosts at locations where we've stayed, which now have expanded beyond Sydney, AU, to include a few locations in our home state of Washington as well as cities such as Paris, France, Vancouver, Canada, England: London, Cornwall and Bath, Oregon: Portland, Seaside, and Bend, California: San Francisco, Sebastopol, Petaluma, Willits, Palm Springs, and Sonora, New York: Williamsburg and Ithaca, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Miami. We've been a guest in 41 different Airbnb listings over the past 6 years. In fact, I can't remember the last time we stayed at a conventional hotel!Since we had such great experiences as guests, we decided to start hosting in the summer of 2012 and listed our guest room on Airbnb. Hosting has proven to be a fantastic experience since we are both seasoned travelers and enjoy chatting with others about their travels, etc.In terms of demographics, we are both in our mid-forties, have traveled all around the country (and the world) and are also are very tidy and respectful.
